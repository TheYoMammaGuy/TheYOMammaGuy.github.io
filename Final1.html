        <div class=""><b>Major Competitors</b></div>
        <p>The major competitors of the VR market are the big tech giants like Google and Facebook but there are a lot of other companies that are less know that compete with them. Valve, Valve which is the mother company to the online video game market place "Steam" is a huge competitor to a huge company like Google or Facebook, Valve makes their own VR gear called the Index and it out performs both of Google's and Facebook's equipment for a higher price. Another Company that specializes in VR is HTC Vive they make a far better headset than anyone else and they also use some their equipment in the medical feild but the only thing that hinders the from becoming the number 1 is thier price starting at $700 they sell their base line headset and most people dont want to invest in something that expensive, on the other hand someone would be able to go out to their local Wallmart and pick up a Quest 2 for $300 which is less than half of Vive's price and it has no need for an external sensor or computer.</p>
